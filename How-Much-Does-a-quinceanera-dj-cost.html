						<h3>Just How Much is a DJ for a Quinceanera for 2021?</h3>

						<p>
							‚ÄúHow much does a DJ for a Quinceanera cost? How much do Quinceanera DJs cost per hour? How much does a DJ cost for 6 hours "and finally" Quinceanera DJs near me "are the most frequently searched questions and terms about Quinceanera and event DJs in Houston and Texas.						</p> 
						
						<p>
							Hundreds of young people and their parents or siblings call us, email us, Facebook us, chat with us on our website, and ask them exactly these questions. Today we are going to help answer these questions for everyone. üôÇ						</p> 
						
						<p>
							The first question, how much does a DJ cost to do a Quinceanera, is actually the single most important question we are asked when it comes to Quinceaneras! However, the answer is not an easy one. The cost of a DJ can vary depending on a few things. Here are the top 5 things that will affect a Quinceanera, wedding, or event DJ price.						</p>
						
						<h3>1. No Set Quinceanera DJ Prices </h3>
						
						<p>
							First, there are no set DJ prices that a Quince DJ charges for their time or services. Some DJs and DJ companies charge by the hour (we do) and others charge by the event. Usually, the DJs that charge by the event, cost more since they‚Äôll basically take the hourly rate they want to get paid, and multiply it times the average number of hours they‚Äôll work. For most weddings or events (most weddings & events are 5-6 hours).
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Prices can vary from as little as $200 for the entire event (usually brand new DJs), up to $6500. Most clients are willing to spend about 8-10% of their total Quinceanera budget, for the DJ and/or entertainment. So do the math and see if the DJ for a Quinceanera, band, or other entertainment you‚Äôre hiring is about this much. You‚Äôre certainly not limited to the 10% rule, but it‚Äôs what we see most often. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
							So honestly, you can easily answer the ‚Äúhow much is a DJ for a quinceanera‚Äù question, simply by doing the math! 
						</p>
						
						<h3>
							2. Costs Vary by Region
						</h3>
						
						<p>
							Another factor that can affect prices in the region or market you are in. A quince in a small, rural town is much cheaper than a quince in Manhattan. Companies know the cost of weddings and events in their market and set their prices accordingly. In larger markets, like ours in Houston, Texas, price is heavily competitive.
						</p>

						<p>
							The average price for a quince DJ in the Houston area is about $1200 ‚Äì $1500 (for just a DJ). There are certainly DJs for as cheap as $200, and DJs that cost as much as $6500! The price varies, depending on what is included with the DJ packages. 
						</p>

						<h3>
							3. New DJs Versus Experienced, Professional DJs
						</h3>

						<p>
							This is where you will truly see a difference in pricing. A new DJ, who is just starting, operates under the ‚ÄúI just want to get my name out there‚Äù business model. If budget is your number one concern, you‚Äôll want to book a newer DJ, to save big! The only issue with doing this is that the DJ has much less experience, and therefore, your experience may be different. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Most new DJs won‚Äôt have all the equipment they‚Äôll need for their events since they‚Äôre just starting. Sure, they can always rent some equipment, but renting equipment isn‚Äôt always a guaranteed good experience. We‚Äôve actually rented equipment that did not work well, unfortunately. This is one drawback. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Another drawback is a lack of experience. Experience and failure are truly the best teachers. Experience truly matters when unexpected situations arise. You don‚Äôt want that DJ to learn what to do next time, at YOUR event. 
						</p>

						<p>
							You always have to expect the unexpected and be prepared for it. Things that have happened to us are: the timeline is completely off track, people are not arriving on time, a song isn‚Äôt playing, the band or mariachis didn‚Äôt show up, etc.
						</p>

						<p>
							Other things that have happened are: the bride‚Äôs dress is accidentally torn, a bride/groom is stung by a bee, unexpected torrential rain happens, power outages, a member of the court got into an accident, a medical emergency happens, a tornado warning is sent to everyone on their phones, etc.
						</p>

						<p>
							When all these things happened, we were prepared and able to change things, as needed, and go with the flow. Most guests never knew a thing in most cases! You won‚Äôt get this with newer DJs. ‚ÄãQuinceaneras and weddings are a once-in-a-lifetime event, so paying for peace of mind and being stress-free on your big day, is truly priceless!
